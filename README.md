# Parkinson's Detection(Research Project)
Final Year Project on PD Detection using voice dataset.
We assessed the performance of three distinct models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. We discovered that, even after several runs, the accuracy and recall percentages of the three models were comparable. An accuracy of roughly 94% and a recall value of around 95% were attributed to each model. However, the average precision value of the CNN model was the greatest, with an average of 97.78% across different test runs. In RF and SVM, the precision values dropped, with RF obtaining a precision of 74.57% and SVM achieving a precision of 77.96%. This helped us conclude that while the three models (which are amongst the most popular ones as per our survey of research papers in the field) all achieve high degrees of accuracy, CNN models are the most preferable. This is because they can help achieve a reliable positive diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease without following in the footsteps of most online symptom checkers that jump to make an excessively sombre consideration of one’s health issues.
